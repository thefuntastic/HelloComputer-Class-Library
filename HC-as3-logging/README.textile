h1. HelloComputer Logging Api

This is a small collection of api features and functions built on top of the very adaptable and flexible "as3commons.logging":http://www.as3commons.org/as3-commons-logging/index.html library. Mostly this was born out of a need to bend the as3 commons library our own way and make it as simple and clean to use in everyday usage - especially for developers with no previous experience with logging. 

h2. Usage

<pre><code>
//Init in main class
Log.setup(new SimpleTargetSetup(new TraceTarget()));

//In your code
log("Hello World", LogLevel.DEBUG);
</code></pre>

The initialisation is directly based on the as3 commons setup property. You can refer to their documentation for all the fun things you can do here. 

Once your logger is setup for output, you can then use the log() function to call this anywhere in your code. This function does a lot of config under the hood to allow you to simply start marking detailed log statements.
